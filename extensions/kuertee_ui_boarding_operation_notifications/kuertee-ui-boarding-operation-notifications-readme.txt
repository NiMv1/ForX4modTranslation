Troubleshooting
===============
(1) Do not change the file structure of the mod. If you do, you'll need to troubleshoot problems you encounter yourself.
(2) Allow the game to log events to a text file by adding "-debug all -logfile debug.log" to its launch parameters.
(3) Enable the mod-specific Debug Log in the mod's Extension Options.
(4) Play for long enough for the mod to log its events.
(5) Send me (at kuertee@gmail.com) the log found in My Documents\Egosoft\X4\(your player-specific number)\debug.log.
