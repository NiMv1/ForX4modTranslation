Instead, a new, domestically designed missile launcher was mounted underneath the the hull, and advanced targeting sensors were integrated into the ship, along with an additional shield generator.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The armament of the Rackham consists out of two defensive turrets, mounted on the top of the ship, and the advanced &quot;Boucan&quot; missile launcher, a rapid fire, VLS missile system capable of firing at targets within a large forward facing arc.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;These upgrades made the Rackham significantly more expensive than planned, but it also made it one of the strongest corvettes in the known galaxy, with significantly increased speed, excellent maneuverability, and powerful armament, a real force to be reckoned with, especially by larger destroyers and capital ships.&#13;&#10;  &#13;&#10;The Rackham quickly gained the attention from other pirates and outlaws, with the Scaleplate Pact especially eager to get their hands on a number of these corvettes for their own nefarious purposes.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;[h1] what does this mod change [/h1]&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;it adds an all new M class ship to the VIG syndicate wharf, as well as in some sector patrols and VIG pirate fleets, its also included into the SCA pirate fleets.  &#13;&#10;ï»¿&#13;&#10;Its equipped with 2 M turret slots, and a single, rapid fire VLS missile launcher main weapon that works similar to that of the Sapporo, its capable of attaining a decent top speed and is maneuverable, and its increased shield strength helps it survive its initial encounter with the enemy. Its balanced by a limited munition storage, its relatively mediocre defensive armament, and lack of any forward facing main guns.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Supports custom paint jobs, and there's an optional VRO patch." author="eva" version="100" date="2025-07-27" save="0" lastupdate="1753583033">
