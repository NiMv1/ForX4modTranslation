Reset on game controller by Mycu

Updates
=======
v7.5.01, 21 Feb 2025:
-Bug-fixes: 7.5 compatibility updates.

Mod effects
===========
1. auto-pilot disengage: mouse to the centre, 2. close of menu: mouse to the centre, 3. open of menu: mouse to the previous mouse position, 4. game controller move: hide mouse, 5. mouse move after game controller move: show mouse, 6. interact menu or conversation menu: disable mouse steering

Requirement
===========
-SirNukes Mod Support APIs mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/503)
-Kuertee's UI Extensions mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/552) - Modded Lua files with callbacks to allow more than one mod to change the same UI element. The detection of game controller happens at the Lua level. This mod uses the "toplevel" menu's update tick. And UIX allows us access to the "toplevel" menu.

Install
=======
-Unzip to 'X4 Foundations/extensions/kuertee_ui_reset_mouse/'.
-Make sure the sub-folders and files are in 'X4 Foundations/extensions/kuertee_ui_reset_mouse/' and not in 'X4 Foundations/extensions/kuertee_ui_reset_mouse/kuertee_ui_reset_mouse/'.

Uninstall
=========
-Delete the mod folder.

Troubleshooting
===============
(1) Do not change the file structure of the mod. If you do, you'll need to troubleshoot problems you encounter yourself.
(2) Allow the game to log events to a text file by adding "-debug all -logfile debug.log" to its launch parameters.
(3) Enable the mod-specific Debug Log in the mod's Extension Options.
(4) Play for long enough for the mod to log its events.
(5) Send me (at kuertee@gmail.com) the log found in My Documents\Egosoft\X4\(your player-specific number)\debug.log.
