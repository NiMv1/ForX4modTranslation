<content id="ws_2082610969" name="TaterTrade" description="This mod includes two scripts: Tatertrader and DeadTater.&#13;&#10;DeadTater is a completely rewritten script from scratch by me, and it uses the logic of comparing trade offers from Ludsoe. The name is a nod to the work from both of us and even as less of his code remains, it would not be possible without his work.&#13;&#10;TaterTrader is the original script updated by me with permission from Ludsoe.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;If you ask me which you should use: DeadTater would be my answer. It is designed to be as efficient and reliable as I could code. Just like the original, it does not use any information unavailable to the vanilla autotrader. It has a built in logistics mode in the option of my faction first that is still &quot;profit based.&quot;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Why is TaterTrader still included? While I have not maintained all the options (homebound, assign to station), it still provides valuable options to the users who prefer it. It is still head and shoulders above vanilla autotrader. I have zero plans to add more factions to the ban section as long as it requires hardcoding factions.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Check the images for explanations on the features of both scripts.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Both DeadTater and TaterTrader use buy/sell offers to function. This means that stations must have funds in their account or they will not generate buy offers.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Both DeadTater and TaterTrader have mimic support built in. You can create trading fleets that each individually perform their respective script.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Both DeadTater and TaterTrader do not cheat information. They use the same information available as the vanilla trade script.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Both DeadTater and TaterTrader respect blacklist and traderule settings, unless overridden.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;DeadTater features:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Profit based trader.&#13;&#10;Adjustable distance penalty calculation.&#13;&#10;My faction first - simplified logistics between player owned stations in range.&#13;&#10;Prefer my buy offers - simplified logistics for supplying player owned stations in range.&#13;&#10;Prefer my sell offers - simplified exporting of wares from player owned stations in range.&#13;&#10;Auto wares - Automatically adjusts ware basket based on trades available in range.&#13;&#10;Illegal wares - Allows trading in illegal goods.&#13;&#10;Minimum fill - Traders will no longer accept trades below cargo capacity percentage.&#13;&#10;Ignore Carrier / Auxillary - Prevents trading with the often buggy ship buyers.&#13;&#10;Logbook entries - Enable or disable log entries showing estimated profit and the traders performance up to that point.&#13;&#10;Global tater queue - Spreads performance impact and prevents individual traders from grabbing the same trade at the same time. Allows large numbers of traders to have near zero performance impact since only one is running intensive logic at a time.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The three prefer options are run in sequence in the order they are presented.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Author: DeadAir&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;TaterTrader Features:&#13;&#10;Attempts to find the best profit based on the configurations of the order given.&#13;&#10;A bunch of settings you change to tweak how and where it trades.&#13;&#10;Only trades with trade offers known to the player.&#13;&#10;Uses the games own built in trade orders to conduct its trades.&#13;&#10;When the Traders home is set to a station, the station becomes the traders commander.&#13;&#10;Traders use their commanders money if they have one.&#13;&#10;The Traders follow faction trade restrictions, unless told otherwise.&#13;&#10;There's ware list presets you can copy within the configuration options.&#13;&#10;Fancy outputting to the player log.&#13;&#10;Station Trader Mode allows you to focus the trader onto a station, to handle all its trade offers.

  <text language="33" name="TaterTrade" description="TaterTrader est un script de négociation automatique WIP qui tente de générer des profits sans utiliser de tricherie.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Objectif:&#13;&#10;TaterTrader est la tentative de Ludsoe de fournir un script de négociation semi-décent. Il tente de rechercher la meilleure transaction dans le cadre des contraintes que vous avez définies lors de la configuration de l'ordre.&#13;&#10;Ludsoe a tenté de maintenir l'équilibre de TaterTrader, car il ne fait que des transactions dont le joueur a connaissance.&#13;&#10;Caractéristiques:&#13;&#10;Tente de trouver le meilleur profit en fonction des configurations de l'ordre donné.&#13;&#10;Un tas de paramètres que vous pouvez modifier pour ajuster comment et où il négocie.&#13;&#10;Ne négocie qu'avec des offres de transaction connues du joueur.&#13;&#10;Utilise les ordres de transaction intégrés au jeu pour effectuer ses transactions. Lorsque la maison des commerçants est placée sur une station, celle-ci devient le commandant des commerçants. Les commerçants utilisent l'argent de leur commandant s'ils en ont un. Le mode Trader de station vous permet de concentrer le trader sur une station et de gérer toutes ses offres commerciales. Peut être utilisé sur les stations appartenant aux joueurs et aux PNJs, même pour les comptes de construction de stockage des stations.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Options de configuration:&#13;&#10;Vous pouvez définir un secteur ou une station d'origine.&#13;&#10;Peut régler le trader pour qu'il retourne toujours &quot;au secteur ou la station d'origine&quot; avant de tenter de rechercher un autre échange. 13;&#10;Vous pouvez configurer les marchandises pour lesquelles le négociant tente de trouver des accords commerciaux.&#13;&#10;La distance maximale de la maison à laquelle le négociant peut acheter ou vendre.&#13;&#10;Modifier le prix que les négociants perçoivent des marchandises de vos propres stations. (N'affecte pas réellement le coût)&#13;&#10;Vous pouvez configurer les négociants pour contourner les restrictions commerciales des factions.&#13;&#10;Vous pouvez exclure des secteurs de la recherche d'offres commerciales.&#13;&#10;Vous pouvez utiliser des listes de marchandises prédéfinies, j'ai copié celles utilisées par le jeu lui-même.
