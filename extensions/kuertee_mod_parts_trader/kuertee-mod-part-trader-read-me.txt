Updates

v7.5.02, 3 Mar 2025:
- Tweak: Russian localisation. Thanks bassted89!

Mod effects
===========
Trade your mod parts for other mod parts. The traders are interested in mod parts and not in credits. You can barter mod parts with them or sell mod parts to them. You can't buy mod parts from them.

Requirements
============
- SirNukes Mod Support APIs mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/503) - for Lua Loader and Simple Menu Options
- Kuertee's UI Extensions mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/552) - Modded Lua files with callbacks to allow more than one mod to change the same UI element. Specifically for this mod, the custom barter menu uses the User Question Menu framework.

Modifications parts trader
==========================
Traders are found (in their offices) at equipment docks, shipyards and wharves.
They have between 5 and 10 different modification parts.

At bars, you can also trade with NPCs who have modification parts in their inventory.
Note that NPCs with modification parts either (1) is a VERY rare occurence or (2) never happens.
But during my tests, I thought I saw one or two NPCs with modification parts.
The availability to trade with them exists, anyway, in case any NPCs with modification parts exists.

Install
=======
- Unzip to 'X4 Foundations/extensions/kuertee_mod_parts_trader/'.
- Make sure the sub-folders and files are in 'X4 Foundations/extensions/kuertee_mod_parts_trader/' and not in 'X4 Foundations/extensions/kuertee_mod_parts_trader/kuertee_mod_parts_trader/'.

Uninstall
=========
- Delete the mod folder.

Troubleshooting
===============
(1) Do not change the file structure of the mod. If you do, you'll need to troubleshoot problems you encounter yourself.
(2) Allow the game to log events to a text file by adding "-debug all -logfile debug.log" to its launch parameters.
(3) Enable the mod-specific Debug Log in the mod's Extension Options.
(4) Play for long enough for the mod to log its events.
(5) Send me (at kuertee@gmail.com) the log found in My Documents\Egosoft\X4\(your player-specific number)\debug.log.

v4.2.07, 2 Jan 2022:
- Bug-fix: Teleporting in and out of stations wasn't detected, so the mod's custom rooms and NPCs were not created when teleporting into a station.

v4.2.01, 13 Dec 2021:
- Bug-fix: Standardised the event listeners for: arrive at station, dock, undock, leave station in my mods that need them with these events: attention change, dock, undock, teleport. In previous versions, these events were handled inconsistently that resulted in intermittent bugs like: (in Reputations and Professions) the Guild Network button become disabled after docking even if it was available before docking, (in High-security Rooms Are Locked) the mission NPC not getting moved to an unlocked room, (in several mods) mod NPCs, like the Mod-Parts Trader not getting spawned in their rooms, etc.
